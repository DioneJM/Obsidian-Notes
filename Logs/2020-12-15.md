#### Checking in on myself
It's currently 1:52am. I am tired but cannot sleep. Currently one of Eric Rosen's chess channels is playing in the background literally behind the window where this note is being written. 

There are quite a number of things on my mind, ranging from trivial to issues that are intrinsic to who I am:
- For the past few months I've felt like I can't talk with anyone at work. All of my conversations with them feel forced and awkward and I focus too much on always having something to say. This is especially evident when talking to my CTO and Founder where I feel like I can't even speak. I don't know why but this makes me worried about what my career progression will be like if I can't do office politics and small talk. This has also kind of extended into my social life and talking to friends who I could talk shit with before I find myself stuttering and talking over myself.
- Outside of work I feel debilitated by the freedom of choice. I want to pick up a hobby outside of bouldering (shoutout to Gemmy who takes me 3x a week) to help stop me from overeating by having something else to distract me with and stop resorting to eating to take care of my boredom. I'm finding it hard to commit to a specific hobby though, the ones I'm considering at the moment can be broken up into the following categories:
	1. Practical hobbies that help me be better: Learning Rust, Learning Piano, Working on a side project, Learning how to write (essays, blogs, etc.)
	2. Playing a game that I can heavily invest my time into: WoW, Maplestory, Chess etc.
	3. Just learning random things in general and amassing a large bank of notes (I've been looking into the Zettalkasten method recently) 
	4. Random skill hobbies: Learning the rubik's cube, drawing
- I've also been having communication issues with my girlfriend. She's been going through a rough patch this past couple of days and I haven't been able to support her through it (not as much as I'd like - she never demanded it). I have this tendency of becoming frustrated when I can't help her or not really considering her problems and making it about me how she's making it hard for me to help her. I don't know if either of us is right (I know I'm not) but I'm not happy with how I deal with it

Lately I feel like the only thing I'm enjoying at the moment is bouldering with Gemmy. It's a perfect balance where I get to do an activity with a friend, where I feel like I'm progressing and constantly learning something new while not having to worry about talking to each other as we're both just focused on figuring out the betas on the problems that stand before us. I know all things must end and the only constant is change, but I hope this stays like it is for a little longer because it's the only time where I feel at ease. 

Overall I feel like I'm in a weird position where I don't really feel like myself. From the way I talk, to even my day to day life - I feel like there's parts that I'm missing that's stopping me from being me.

side note: I'm typing this on my desktop and it feels nice being to type on a mechanical keyboard. I've forgotten how nice it feels.
