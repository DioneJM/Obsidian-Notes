#### Checking in on myself
It's currently 1:52am. I am tired but cannot sleep. Currently one of Eric Rosen's chess channels is playing in the background literally behind the window where this note is being written. 

There are quite a number of things on my mind, ranging from trivial to issues that are intrinsic to who I am:
- For the past few months I've felt like I can't talk with anyone at work. All of my conversations with them feel forced and awkward and I focus too much on always having something to say. This is especially evident when talking to my CTO and Founder where I feel like I can't even speak. I don't know why but this makes me worried about what my career progression will be like if I can't do office politics and small talk. This has also kind of extended into my social life and talking to friends who I could talk shit with before I find myself stuttering and talking over myself.
- Outside of work I feel debilitated by the freedom of choice. I want to pick up a hobby outside of bouldering (shoutout to Gemmy who takes me 3x a week) to help stop me from overeating by having something else to distract me with and stop resorting to eating to take care of my boredom. I'm finding it hard to commit to a specific hobby though, the ones I'm considering at the moment can be broken up into the following categories:
	1. Practical hobbies that help me be better: Learning Rust, Learning Piano, Working on a side project, Learning how to write (essays, blogs, etc.)
	2. Playing a game that I can heavily invest my time into: WoW, Maplestory, Chess etc.
	3. Just learning random things in general and amassing a large bank of notes (I've been looking into the Zettalkasten method recently) 
	4. Random skill hobbies: Learning the rubik's cube, drawing
- I've also been having communication issues with my girlfriend. She's been going through a rough patch this past couple of days and I haven't been able to support her through it (not as much as I'd like - she never demanded it). I have this tendency of becoming frustrated when I can't help her or not really considering her problems and making it about me how she's making it hard for me to help her. I don't know if either of us is right (I know I'm not) but I'm not happy with how I deal with it

Lately I feel like the only thing I'm enjoying at the moment is bouldering with Gemmy. It's a perfect balance where I get to do an activity with a friend, where I feel like I'm progressing and constantly learning something new while not having to worry about talking to each other as we're both just focused on figuring out the betas on the problems that stand before us. I know all things must end and the only constant is change, but I hope this stays like it is for a little longer because it's the only time where I feel at ease. 

Overall I feel like I'm in a weird position where I don't really feel like myself. From the way I talk, to even my day to day life - I feel like there's parts that I'm missing that's stopping me from being me.

side note: I'm typing this on my desktop and it feels nice being to type on a mechanical keyboard. I've forgotten how nice it feels.

##### 10:59pm
The rest of the day was another struggle. I was tired and couldn't focus during work so I got barely anything done and throughout the day Shenin and I were talking about how we felt with what happened last night. We didn't really manage to figure things out so we're going to meet up tomorrow at her place and talk in person to better communicate what we feel. 
For some reason I have a lot less patience on messenger when it comes to being misunderstood and today I was seething that I was constantly being misunderstood and that I was having a hard time understanding her feelings. I hope we can get to the bottom of it tomorrow - I'll be writing some personal notes to share with her beforehand to make sure that all of my thoughts and concerns are addressed and I hope she does something similar to so that I can get a better understanding of what she feels. One of the main issues that I have right now is that I have written down some suggestion on how she can communicate better but I haven't been able to do so for myself and she hasn't raised anything either. I know I'm not perfect so I hope she'll be able to talk about what I can do better. 

I was able to decompress after work since I went bouldering. I've been projecting this pink for a couple of sessions now and I've made some progress for the crux of the route. I need to figure out how to drop my knee and pivot my hips to increase my reach when the footholds are small and I'm turning my foot towards the outer edge. Once I do that though I think I'll be able to send it. Other than that I've noticed improvements going up on the problems that I've already done I think it's part strength and part familiarity but I'm feeling a lot more stable doing the teals and definitely the blues. 

For eating today I feel like i fared pretty well. I only had a iced long black with a drop of milk in the morning, chicken salad for lunch and beef lasagne for dinner. Throughout the day I was drinking a couple cans of soda water but also had probably ~9ish chocolate gold coins. Per serving (20g) it's around 104 calories and I'd estimate that's about 2 coins so I had around ~450 calories in chocolate. That's a lot actually so I doubt I was in the deficit by that much if at all.
